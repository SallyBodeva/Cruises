# EnchantedEscala-Cruises

Interested in embarking on this project?

Here's how to get started:

Head over to the appDbContext and within the connection string, replace the server name with the name of your SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio) server.

Be prepared to handle some migrations. Copy and paste this command into your package manager: "Update-Database -Project Cruise.Data -StartupProject Cruise.Data."

Set your startup project to "DataSeeder" and launch it to populate your database with data.

You're nearly there! Just one more thing to doâ€”enjoy the project as you steer your own Cruise Company. Bon voyage!
